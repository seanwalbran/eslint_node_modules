**NOTE:** This gem is unmaintained; it was a brief attempt to provide
an offline-friendly up-to-date eslint installation for a ruby app,
which now uses an npm meta-package approach using
[bundledDependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#bundleddependencies)
for offline-friendliness instead.

--

A ruby gem packaging up the [eslint](http://eslint.org/) node modules.

The version number reflects the ESLint version in the first three
positions, with an optional value in the fourth position reflecting
changes in the gem/wrapping ruby code.
